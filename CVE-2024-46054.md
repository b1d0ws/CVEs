# OpenVidReview 1.0 Unrestricted File Upload

### Description

The **/upload** route is not protected by authentication, allowing any user to upload files without restriction.

This vulnerability exposes the application to unauthorized file uploads and potential abuse, including the risk of server overload.

### Recommendations

Secure the /upload route by enforcing authentication and authorization checks. Implement access controls to ensure that only authorized users can upload files.
